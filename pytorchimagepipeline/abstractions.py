"""This module defines abstract base classes for the Pytorch image pipeline.

Classes:
    AbstractObserver: Base class for the Observer class.
    Permanence: Base class for objects that persist through the entire pipeline lifecycle.
    PipelineProcess: Abstract base class for pipeline processes.
